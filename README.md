# CFG-spreadsheet-analysis
Over the past 2 months we have participated in the Code First Girls 'Introduction to Python Programming' course . The following code is our collabatory attempt at the final project titled Spreadsheet analysis.
The first cell shows our analysis of some generic sales data provided by Code First Girls. For the second cell, we were encouraged to analyse any table of our choice and so we decided to do so with a COVID-19 lab-confirmed cases dataset released by gov.uk.
